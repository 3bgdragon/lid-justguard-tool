# Compatibility candidate 1.2.0-rc.1 — 2026-10-04

Compatibility candidate, 2026-10-04; reviewed Steam build 25386710. Actual Nico DB Mod Manager 0.10.1 and TFC Installer 2.5.6.0 engines were tested separately from S3er0i9ng Mod Manager 1.3.20. File-copy tests passed; this update has NOT been retested through the GUI or in live gameplay. Unknown/conflicting layouts remain blocked. External managers can still overwrite files from cached originals; detected preset loss requires selected-feature reinstallation, not an old whole-file restore.

[Complete interoperability evidence](COMPATIBILITY-VALIDATION.md). Final recovery-journal/standalone-mode safety regression tests are also bundled.

## Historical validation below

# Validation — TFC edition 1.0.0, 2026-10-03

## Four-mod preflight update — 2026-10-04 (included in this compatibility candidate)

Repository-level evidence is in `COMPATIBILITY-VALIDATION.md` at the repository
root; that document is not required to run the separate TFC ZIP.
The generated-package workflow preserves reviewed independent edits before
TFC writes, then validates merged bodies and registered feature states before
native writes. Installing static templates directly bypasses this workflow.
The new actual-file suite passed 17/17 using E-drive disposable copies.

Reviewed Steam build 25386710, package version 861/19.

## Configurable preset follow-up

- 4 timing choices x 2 Groggy x 2 melee choices: 15 non-stock mod folders generated; all-stock configuration instructs removal.
- Six reviewed variant assets exported via the official library and applied/reopened through the actual TFC engine.
- All common variants preserve their 5 expected objects; runtime variants combined with warp/M2G/vending preserve 15 / 20 / 21 expected objects.
- Original soft/on/on generated assets are byte-identical to the user-playtested fixed release.
- Independent elemental protection combinations are explicitly rejected. No independent elemental bytecode change or new game test is claimed.
- No real game files were changed during these option tests.

- Actual UPK Explorer / TFC Installer 2.5.6.0 UPK.Utils.dll and native LZO used.
- BrgGame patches: guard 7, warp 2, M2G 1, vending 11 objects; all 21 are disjoint.
- All 24 orders serialized/reopened and retained every expected object payload.
- Guard common package: 5 objects; warp map: 11 updates, 439 names / 224 exports.
- Companion tests: native installation/removal orders, unrelated edit preservation, failure and actual child-process termination recovery.
- Actual MASTER DB copy: 106 materials inserted/removed; unrelated shop rows preserved.
- Real reinstalled game: all four applied via actual TFC PackageUpdater; object readback, EXE links and DB integrity passed.
- The user launched the game and confirmed successful operation on 2026-10-03.

The real installation used TFC's engine directly with a separate full-file backup, not TFC GUI installation history. Complete GUI install/uninstall is a separate validation scope.
This confirmation does not prove every boss, weapon, daily restock cycle, foreign mod or other build. Same-object edits can conflict.
